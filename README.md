 I will try to ensure the above link is always up. 
 Due to issues deploying to Heroku, using C9 
 as a temp solution.
 
## How to Use
- Configure config.js (setup db)
- Run utils to insert data into your db
- Start backend
- Go to localhost:port

## Technologies
* MEAN
* Mongoose
* Bootstrap
* C9 (dev on the go)

## Future Enhancements
* More content
* Explaination on how to read the tables
* Document api (see /ap/routes for now)
* Graphics (pics and graphs)
* Proper debugging / tests

## Known Issues
* Slow load on heavy data pages
* Champ Naming is a function w/i controller right now, want to create a service
* Correct dynamic route syntax to properly return 404 instead of 200 for "empty" res
* Bad comments on commits due to testing Heroku deployment
