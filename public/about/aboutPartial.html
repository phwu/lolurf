<div>
    <p>This is an application submission for <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/bX8Z86bm" target="_blank">Riot's First API Challenge</a>. 
    It is a two week challenge that involves using game data from <strong><abbr title="Ultra Rapid Fire">U.R.F</abbr></strong> matches and using various endpoints 
    provided by Riot to create something (anything!).
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this application is to have a high level overview of URF game data that is easily readable by us humans. The design used the original api-match endpoint to feed 
    match ids into the application's own database. From there, a utility was used to fetch all the match data from the match endpoint and dissect and populate into collections I thought 
    would be best for the purpose of this app. <strong>ALL</strong> the data is based on what is in the application's database, <em>not</em> Riot's. You may experience some "lag" inbetween 
    loading certain pages, especially the Players' page. This is because all the information you see is dynamic and live! That means if the database got updated, the page would update 
    instantaneously too. As more matches are loaded into the database, more documents (rows) need to be processed. Think of it this way though: see the number on the front page/dashboard for 
    Total Matches Played? Well all the data you see on this site is from that many number of matches! ;)</p>
    <p>Technically, this web application uses a <strong><abbr title="MongoDB Express Angular Node">MEAN</abbr></strong> stack and comprises of both a REST back end 
    application and an Angular front end application using Bootstrap. I followed the <a href="https://github.com/meanjs/mean">MEANJS</a> example
    and highly encourage those interested in full webstack development in JS to "check it out" ;) . The application's database is hosted externally via
    MongoLab and I highly recommend them as well.</p>
    <p>Technologies Used:
        <ul>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>ExpressJS</li>
            <li>AngularJS</li>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>MongooseJS</li>

    <h1>Meet <small>the Developer</small></h1>
</div>
<div>
    <p>My name is Polly Hwu and I am currently a junior application developer. I graduated from the University of Florida in May 2013 and started working full time the following July.
    Currently I work on enterprise applications using Java and Spring with MSSQL in the financial industry. If you know something about technology, you'd have realized by now that the technologies I
    use at work differ significantly from that ones I've used for The URF Games.
    </p>
    <p>I would like to work for Riot some day. I hope this submission to the challenge catches someone's eye. Winning would also be a great thing as I can feed my inner skin junkie.</p>
    <p>To all those participating, <em>may the odds be ever in your favor</em>!</p>
