                <p>This is an application submission for <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/bX8Z86bm" target="_blank">Riot's First API Challenge</a>. 
                It is a two week challenge that involves using game data from <strong><abbr title="Ultra Rapid Fire">U.R.F</abbr></strong> matches and using various endpoints 
                provided by Riot to create something (anything!).
                </p>
                <p>This web application uses a <strong><abbr title="MongoDB Express Angular Node">MEAN</abbr></strong> stack and comprises of both a REST back end 
                application and an Angular front end application using Bootstrap. I followed the <a href="https://github.com/meanjs/mean">MEANJS</a> example
                and highly encourage those interested in full webstack development in JS to "check it out" ;) . The application's database is hosted externally via
                MongoLab and I highly recommend them as well.</p>
                <p>Technologies Used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MongoDB</li>

                        <li>AngularJS</li>
                        <li>NodeJS</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap</li>

            <div>
                <p>My name is Polly Hwu and I am currently a junior application developer. I graduated from the University of Florida in May 2013 and started working full time the following July.
                Currently I work on enterprise applications using Java and Spring with MSSQL. If you know something about technology, you'd have realized by now that the technologies I
                use at work differ significantly from that ones I've used for The URF Games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strongly felt the need to learn something new as I wanted to be more marketable and advance my career. Yes, Java is great, but I have only been working
                    corporate for &lt; 2 years and it is something I am already trying to get away from. I also must admit I didn't really work on projects outside of work for a really
                    long time because I didn't care (tbh). I needed motivation... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then, a gleaming light, the holy grail! If there is one thing I enjoy (not enjoy?) wasting time on, it's playing LoL. And one late night, I saw "API Challenge" 
                    and I thought, "Wait, API, like for developers?" As I read more, I got really excited. Then I got even more excited when slacker00 posted job openings. It honestly never crossed 
                    my mind to work for Riot but this opportunity was to freakin good to pass on. It also convinced me to bear the pain of learning callbacks and nosql for the opportunity to put 
                    "Riot API Challenge" on my CV/resume. This was definitely a fun challenge and I hope I win at least 2nd prize. The RP can feed my skin junkie needs.
                </p>
                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> RITO, HIRE ME, PLS!!1!1!! I need the RP discounts.</p>
